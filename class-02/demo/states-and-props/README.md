# (React Props and State) __DEMO__

## __Summary__

In todays app we are going to create a small app that will do the following:

- Display our pets (name, image)
- We wil be also petting our cats on their heads!
- Prettify our page using [react bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/#installation)

___

## __Implementation__

- For displaying our pets we are going to need a parent component, and a ChildCat component and use them accordingly.

- We will be using props to send information back and forth between components.

- We will be using state to include new default properties in our Class component.

- For styling the page we will be using [react bootstrap components](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/components/cards/), so make sure to go through the documentation.

- After that you will need to deploy the app to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com).
